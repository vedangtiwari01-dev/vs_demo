  "overall_summary": "Analysis of 9 deviations across 5 cases reveals a systemic pattern where Income Verification is universally skipped (100% of cases) while officers introduce alternative assessment steps (APPROVAL, CREDIT_ASSESSMENT, RISK_REVIEW) not defined in the standard SOP. This suggests a fundamental disconnect between the documented SOP and actual operational practices. All deviations occurred during evening hours (7 PM), indicating either batch processing or end-of-day reconciliation activities.

    "Critical Control Failure: 100% bypass rate of Income Verification represents complete breakdown of fundamental credit risk control. This is not sporadic deviation but systematic non-compliance indicating the control is either impossible to execute or culturally rejected",

  "recommendations": [
    "[critical] Emergency SOP Reconciliation: Conduct immediate gap analysis between documented SOP and actual practices. Convene cross-functional team (Operations, Credit, Compliance, IT) to either: (A) Revise SOP to reflect actual workflow with proper controls, or (B) Implement documented SOP with system enforcement. Current state creates severe regulatory and audit risk",
    "[critical] Implement Hard Controls for Income Verification: Add system-enforced checkpoints requiring income document upload, verification, and approval before loan can proceed. Remove officer ability to skip this step. For any legitimate exceptions (e.g., existing customers with recent verification), create documented override process with senior approval and audit trail",
    "[high] Formalize Relationship Banking Procedures: Document criteria for existing customer fast-track processing including: (1) Recency of last income verification (e.g., within 6 months), (2) Account performance requirements, (3) Maximum loan amount without re-verification, (4) Approval authority matrix. Implement system flags to identify eligible customers automatically",
    "[high] Standardize Risk-Based Workflow Tiers: Formalize the informal ticket-size tiering observed in practice. Create documented workflow variants for: (1) Low-ticket standard customers, (2) High-ticket/high-EMI cases, (3) Existing customers, (4) Digital channel, (5) Special segments (students, etc.). Each tier should have clear criteria, required steps, and approval authorities documented in SOP",
    "[high] Deploy Real-Time Compliance Monitoring: Replace batch evening compliance checks with in-workflow real-time alerts. When officer attempts to skip required step or perform unexpected step, trigger immediate notification with: (1) Reason code requirement, (2) Supervisor notification for high-risk deviations, (3) Block progression for critical control bypasses. Capture compliance data at point of decision, not end of day",
    "[medium] Workload and Incentive Analysis: Investigate why 100% of officers follow identical workarounds. Analyze: (1) Daily case volume vs. time required for full SOP compliance, (2) Performance incentives that may reward speed over compliance, (3) Training adequacy on Income Verification procedures, (4) System usability issues making compliance difficult. Address root causes driving systematic non-compliance",
    "[medium] Channel-Specific SOP Documentation: Formalize the digital channel workflow observed with EMP-DIGI including Video KYC, regional credit approval, and additional risk review. Ensure all channels have documented procedures with appropriate controls for their risk profiles. Prevent undocumented workflow divergence",
    "[medium] Weekly Processing Pattern Review: Investigate Thursday deviation peak. If driven by weekly targets or credit committee schedules, implement: (1) Workload smoothing across week, (2) Enhanced quality checks on high-volume days, (3) Supervisor spot-checks during peak periods, (4) Consider staggered targets to reduce pressure-driven shortcuts"
